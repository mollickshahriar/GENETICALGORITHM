# GENETICALGORITHM
Genetical Algorithm by Python
Genetic Algorithms are a class of algorithms designed to explore large search space and find global minimal or maximum optimal solution using mimicking evolution and natural selection. The process of using genetic algorithms goes like this: 
1.Determine the problem and goal.
2.Break-down the solution to bite-sized properties which is called chromosome. 
3.Build a population by randomizing. 
4.Evaluate each unit in the population.
5.Pick child chromosomes from each parent which is also called selective breed.
6.Rinse and repeat.
